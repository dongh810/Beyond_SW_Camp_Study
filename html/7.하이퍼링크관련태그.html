        "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
         by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble 
         that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, 
         which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and eas
         y to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our be
         ing able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain ci
         rcumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that plea
         sures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to 
         this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains
          to avoid worse pains."
